### **Hackathon Participation â€“ AI for Connectivity**  
I participated in the **AI for Connectivity** hackathon, where I collaborated with a team to develop AI-driven solutions for enhancing network efficiency and secure communication. My contributions included:  

- **Mathematical Modeling & Algorithm Development:** Applied **linear algebra, optimization techniques, and cryptographic principles** to design AI models for secure and efficient data transmission.  
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Assisted in implementing **ML algorithms** to optimize network performance and **detect anomalies** in data communication.  
- **Cryptographic Enhancements:** Proposed **post-quantum cryptographic techniques** to ensure security in AI-driven connectivity solutions.  
- **Python-Based Implementation:** Developed and optimized Python scripts for data processing and analysis.  

Our solution focused on improving **network security, data transmission efficiency, and real-time anomaly detection.** This experience strengthened my expertise in **AI, cryptography, and mathematical optimization** for secure and scalable connectivity solutions.
